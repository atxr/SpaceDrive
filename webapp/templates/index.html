        <h1>Satellite File Upload</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Satellite File Upload portal. This portal allows you to securely upload files to our satellite
            systems orbiting Earth.</p>
        <p>Our satellites are equipped with advanced sensors and instruments that collect various types of data,
            including weather patterns, environmental changes, and astronomical observations. To ensure the smooth
            operation of these satellites, it's essential to regularly upload firmware updates, configuration files, and
            scientific data.</p>
        <p>Using this portal, you can securely transmit files to our satellites from anywhere on Earth. Once uploaded,
            our satellite communication systems will process and integrate the data seamlessly into our satellite
            networks.</p>

            <p class="note">Note: Submitted files will be scanned to detect malicious patterns. Our team has developed a
                specific tool to scan zip files.</p>
